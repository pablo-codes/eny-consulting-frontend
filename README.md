## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pablo-codes/eny-consulting-frontend.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd eny-consulting-frontend
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Backend Configuration**
    This frontend application is designed to connect to a backend API. The API service in (`src/services/api.js`) is pre-configured to use `http://localhost:5000/api/` for local development. Ensure your local backend server is running on port `5000`. No `.env` file is required for this default setup.

5.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore its features:

- **Chat with the AI Assistant**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. The main page features the chat interface. You can ask questions such as:
  - "What is the SAMC certification?"
  - "Tell me about your coaching programs."
  - "How can I land a six-figure job in business analysis?"
- **Check System Health**: Navigate to `/health` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/#/health`) to view the operational status of the backend services. You can refresh the status manually.
- **Export Lead Data**: Navigate to `/export` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/#/export`) to download a CSV file containing all tracked lead interactions.
